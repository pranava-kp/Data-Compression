Predicting the Best Compression Tool for a Given File

Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the most effective compression tool for a given file without applying actual compression. By analyzing file characteristics and learning from past compression results, the model helps users select the optimal method for storage and transfer efficiency.

Key Features

- Predicts the best compression tool (e.g., Zip, WinRAR, gzip, bzip2) based on file properties.
- Supports multiple file types: text, structured data, images, and audio.
- Eliminates manual testing of different tools.

Dataset

The dataset includes 5,000+ samples across:

- Text files (TXT, JSON, Markdown)
- Structured data files (CSV)
- Image files (JPG, PNG)
- Audio files (MP3, WAV)
