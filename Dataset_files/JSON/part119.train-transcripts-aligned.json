The package of shirts on the table behind her, the newspapers scattered all over the couch and floor, the sound of windblown rain washing the side of the building outside, and the silence of the room as we stood across from one another and watched while we each, simultaneously, removed our own clothing. My robe, her blouse and skirt, my pajama top, her slip and bra, my pajama bottoms, her underpants, until we were both standing naked in the harsh, gray light, two naked members of the same species. A male and a female. The male somewhat younger and slightly less scarred than the female, the female somewhat less delicately constructed than the male. Both individuals, pale-skinned, with dark thatches of hair in the areas of their genitals, both individuals standing slackly as if a great, protracted tension between them had at last been released.",

It was only later, when I could think of her as dead, I could come out and say it-- \"my friend Sarah Cole is dead\"-- that I was able to tell this story. For that is when she began to enter my memories, my dreams and reveries. In that way, I learned that I truly did love her, and now I have begun to grieve over her death, to wish her alive again, so that I can say to her the things I could not know or say when she was alive, when I did not know that I loved her.",

And there are so many of them, I do not even know if I've got them all. Are you ready? There is the vice president in a lawsuit over whether he has to release the names of people that he met with in forming his energy policy. There's the executive order that lets former presidents keep more of their old documents secret. There's the official Bush administration policy not to release any document under the Freedom of Information Act if there is any legal way to avoid it. Committee chairmen in Congress-- these are Republicans, mind you, Republicans-- are complaining publicly that they cannot get information out of the administration, out of the agencies that they are supposed to be overseeing.",

Soon after the Ashcroft press conference, Newman went to court to find out what happened to her client. She was told she no longer had a client, because her client no longer had a lawyer. But Newman wouldn't hear it. She kept on filing motions as if the old routines of the law were still in place. That said, she was in uncharted terrain, and the problems she encountered were often surreal.",

And part of what's so confusing about Padilla is that so many other defendants have been lawyered up. Remember John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Taliban? He was actually captured on the field of battle in Afghanistan. Now that's an enemy combatant. He got lawyered up. The Buffalo Six, those young Muslims who slipped into Afghanistan and then came back to America? Arrested and lawyered up. How about Zacarias Moussaoui? He's not even an American. He's a French Moroccan, and was allegedly the 20th guy on September 11. Lawyered up. In the end, it may be that the real reason Padilla has been refused a lawyer is not the alarming evidence against him, but the opposite.",

The Pakistani embassy's list had over 100 people on it. The ACLU, with the help of a Pakistani civil rights group, tracked down about 35 of those. 19 were willing to talk to the press. Of these, the ACLU people set up interviews with five whose cases they thought were compelling. And yes, in some instances, the US government seems to have behaved in ways I think many Americans would think was pretty unfair. But I have to say, other times things didn't seem so bad, even in these hand-picked cases. But you can judge for yourself. Also there was one nagging question every deportee had. I'll get to that later.",

It's worth mentioning that these are pretty common offenses. By the government's own estimates, there are over a quarter million people in the United States who have overstayed their visas and have been told to leave. So what brought 25 FBI agents to Ansar's door and not others? That's a mystery. But still, an overstayed visa is a deportable offense. As for all the secrecy, Uzer thinks it's because the government is embarrassed. It doesn't want to be seen picking on families like his.",

That's my question to the Bush administration right now. If they listen to this, I want to ask them to say sorry and give my house back and give my life back. It's not hard for them.
