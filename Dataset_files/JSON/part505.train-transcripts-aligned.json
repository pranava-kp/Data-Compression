He'd go fishing on a rowboat with his dad. Then the city started filling in huge sections of the lake with garbage and incinerator ash. He'd come here in the '70s and see bulldozers pushing around the rubble of some of Chicago's great buildings, which had been recently demolished.",

There are zoning maps of the city that show streets and complete neighborhoods -- a whole grid of them-- that nobody ever got around to building. Instead, now, on top of all the trash stands a golf course. Charlie says that from the clubhouse, he gets exactly the same view that he used to get back when he and his dad took out the rowboat. It's the same spot. That's where the lake once was. You can see clear to downtown. So far away, it might as well be another city.",

He found a stick and a piece of red cloth and made a flag to signal passing ships. Then he found several big pieces of Styrofoam and some wood and spent an hour or two fashioning a raft, but it collapsed when he sat down on it. Undeterred, he went back to searching for something that would be his ticket off the island. And then he found it. It was the hollowed out carcass of a jet ski-- or as he calls it, a scooter.",

To which Alex answers-- precisely as I know he will, the only way he possibly can. He says, but what if I told everybody?",

She said she was just playing, and walked toward the center of the bridge. I went with her, and she-- very ordinarily-- dialed her cell phone. When I returned at 1:10, I discovered that she had already climbed up on the bridge railing. I restrained her and forced her onto a moped. She is from Nanjing's Jianye district.",

I at once restrained him and dragged him to safety. As we spoke, I learned the situation was actually quite funny. He was thinking about jumping because last year, his wife promised to start returning to him 200 Yuan of his monthly 1,400 Yuan salary to spend as he pleased. But she had not honored her promise.",

Your sweetest childhood memory. You can walk into that, and you can walk into it by surprise in the middle of the day in the middle of the city.",
