We assumed the police were going to arrive at any moment and that our gathering in one place was a polite way to make their job easier.

I had almost brutalized a stranger. Worst of all, I wasn't sure which I felt worse about, almost doing it or not doing it.",

Think about all the meetings that you would have to have, all the coordination, and for what? We have our own money now. It works fine. Why would we ever do that?",

We spent a lot of time talking to all sorts of people who were present at the creation of the euro, who dreamed and worked for years, decades, to make it happen. Planet Money's Chana Joffe-Walt and our colleague, Zoe Chace, tell the story of why they wanted it to happen and what they chose to ignore along the way.",

You buy a bond for $1 million from someone with the promise that they're going to pay you back in full, with interest, over some period of time.

When he starts selling all his Greek bonds, people all over the world pay attention. El-Erian must know something. He's really smart. And then everywhere people are selling their Greek bonds. And what really struck me is how imbalanced things are. For PIMCO it's just not that big a deal to sell all their Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. It's a few clicks on a keyboard, moving around a relatively small amount of their overall money. But for the countries whose bonds they're selling, it feels a lot more like the end of the world.",

Instead of seeing all the euro countries as the same-- safe, boring, basically Germany-- they saw them all as opposite. They went back to being what they were before-- individual countries with individual problems. Some looked like a safe bet to loan money to, others, maybe they'd get their money back but maybe they wouldn't. And for those countries, the ones they were worried about, it just gets harder and harder to find anyone to lend them money.",

He, like the majority of his colleagues here, have worked in the Statistics Office for decades. In the summer of 2010, a European technocrat arrived in the building to lead the Greek old guard into this new European world. His name Andreas Georgiou. He's Greek, but he's been living abroad for decades. And he's kind of a no-nonsense numbers guy, the guy who opens an interview by telling you he'd prefer you disappear.",
