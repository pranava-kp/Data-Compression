I'm thinking about you. I'm thinking about how this was all your idea to go the Dark Shadows convention. True, I introduced you to the show, but you were the one who really took it to heart. I feel like I'm going on a journey somehow. A journey to meet people that, I don't know, maybe they'll have something in common with me.",

And I'm going, of course I'm going to go to this convention. Even though the show is just a show to me, I really want to go.

Thax ?] and Erica during their weekly ritual of watching Dark Shadows. And I'm here to tell you, after I re-watch several hours of this, it's boring, it's slow, the acting is terrible, the plot lines are preposterous and apparently take months-- sometimes years-- to resolve. But it's live TV. And it's got that feeling. And if you watch long enough, you can see people forget lines, scripts are left on beds during scenes, prop guys get caught on screen. You can see them through doorways. Flies settle on the actors' faces. And this is part of what John and his friends love when they watch. John watches six hours a week, taped off the SciFi channel.",

I want to think of the things Dark Shadows has given me. How it's taught me to forgive, how it's taught me the joy of friendship, how it's taught me that you need to go on from bad situations. And then she said, and most people will listen to this and they will think that I'm a crackpot. And if I'm a crackpot, so be it. And then she screams into the mike, Dark Shadows lives.

He's visiting the National Restaurant Association, which is made up of restaurant owners, managers, and suppliers. They are a force to be reckoned with in this country, especially in Washington, DC, important opponents of the minimum wage and Bill Clinton's national health care plan, a few years ago. The National Restaurant Association's political ally, Newt Gingrich, has stated that their lobbying was instrumental in defeating the health care proposal.",

I hadn't planned to be so informal with these people. I came to the show to be inconspicuous and to inspect, not to socialize and rub shoulders with folks who might otherwise be my boss.",

Their model dish machines would surely be staffed by real live dishwashers. Hobart's display was quite a spectacle, buzzing with activity, with free beer, and dozens of chirpy sales reps wearing matching bright blue shirts. I half expected there to be bikini-clad women, lounging atop their displayed dish machines.",

The other convention, the American Psychiatric Association. Our story starts on the border of those two. John Perry Barlow is a former rancher, song lyricist, now head of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He travels everywhere, talking about computers. And that is what brought him to the Moscone Center for a convention in 1993.",

And for the best perspective on the subject, all of our stories today take place in the city that has the reputation for being the unkindest city in America, New York City. Act One of our show, Tarzan Finds a Mate, in which a good deed is done with the hope of a small reward. Act Two, Runaway, in which a small good deed leads to much bigger things. Act Three, the Unkindness of Strangers, a story about a neighbor who tries to make life hell for the person next door. Act Four, Chairman of the Block, a story of 150 people who don't know each other, a tap dancer, New York cops, and Frank Sinatra. Stay with us.",

I look up and a young woman is standing next to a red sports car, her head resting on the roof. \"Damn, damn, damn,\" she moans, pounding an alternate fist down with each word. She steps back, her hands on her hips, and looks around as if for a lost child. She has straight blond hair which hangs down to her shoulders. She's wearing tight blue jeans, a yellow shirt unbuttoned down to her cleavage, and black spike heels. She's got on bright red lipstick and gold interlocking circles for earrings. They jangle when she turns her head.",
