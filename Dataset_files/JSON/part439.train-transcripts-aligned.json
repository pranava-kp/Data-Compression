And I knew that, OK, if I build a tunnel, it came from childhood reasons, but at the same time, if I build it, who knows? I could probably hang out there, turn that childhood dream into a man cave, a bunker, whatever you call it, just a place to go hang out. And if there's something that happened, like a natural disaster or something that would happen, I could go there if there's a blackout, turn on the generator, charge my phone, even make a small meal down there just to bring back up to my house.",

It seemed so clear to everybody else, and she would not do it. This teenager met a producer from a public radio station, WNYC, a producer named Courtney Stein, two years ago. Courtney works on this project called Radio Rookies. And the teenager, her name is Rainy. She was 17 years old at the time. She applied to be in the Radio Rookies program. She wanted to make a radio story. And she wanted to talk about how she had been in an abusive relationship for a long time and was trying to figure out why she stayed in it for so long.",
