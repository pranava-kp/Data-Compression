The next thing I did was call Diane Bradshaw back and ask her if she knew anyone who could be easily hypnotized and wouldn't mind having amnesia. And she said yes, he's coming by this afternoon. If you came by around 4:00, we could ask him.",

I think what happened as we went along is that the people who felt he was guilty did not look at anything to the contrary. I got a sense that there was no sense that there might be reasonable doubt or there could be reasonable doubt. So whenever anyone in the room raised an issue that might have questioned the guilty verdict, those that felt that he was guilty were very antagonistic, very hostile, very critical, very demeaning.",
