[1-15-16, 17] The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous \nchapter'sgaruDa-yajnavedi, Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests \nof Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also calledsuparNa, \nthe Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also calledsuparNa, \nthe golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle \nof Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here \nthis Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of \nVedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious \ncarrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Sun's coming mounted on a black cloud has some \nthing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable \ncombination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall \nis due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, \nin the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun \nboth are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called \nRavana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains."

They are said \n\t\t\tto be the children of the sun and the nymph As'vin, who is one of the lunar asterisms \n\t\t\tpersonified.

Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining \n\t\t\tEmperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made \n\t\t\tthe three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. [1-29-20, \n\t\t\t21] The myth is that Vaamna, the dwarfish ascetic boy, approaches Emperor \n\t\t\tBali and begs of him for a space enough to place his three dwarfish \n\t\t\tfoot-steps. While all around that ritual hall of Bali laugh at this \n\t\t\tboy's request, Bali comes to know who this dwarfish boy is. Though known \n\t\t\tto be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating from his vow of \n\t\t\taccording charities in 'as is where is condition', Bali accords that \n\t\t\tmuch space to the boy. Then Vaamna places one dwarfish foot on this \n\t\t\tglobe and the entire globe is covered with it. Vaamna then asks Bali \n\t\t\twhere to put the second foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly \n\t\t\tworlds are conquered by Bali and are under his control at that time. \n\t\t\tVaamana places his second dwarfish foot on all the heavenly worlds covering \n\t\t\tall of them. Then again, Vaamana asks Bali as to where the third foot-space \n\t\t\tis. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vaamana places his foot \n\t\t\ton this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali's head and starts to trample \n\t\t\thim topaataala-loka, nether worlds. At the time of donating \n\t\t\tthe charity, while Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of \n\t\t\tVaamana, Sage Shukraachaarya, the demon's high priest, knowing this dwarf \n\t\t\tboy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the water pot so that the donation \n\t\t\twater may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus to fail the donation. \n\t\t\tKnowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vaamana pierces \n\t\t\tthe nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing \n\t\t\tone eye of Sage Shukraachaarya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed \n\t\t\tsage, symbolically meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on \n\t\t\tthe side of demon's welfare. Vaamana places his third step on the head \n\t\t\tof Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, freeing the other \n\t\t\tworlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, \n\t\t\tthough subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming \n\t\t\tmanvantara-s, eras. Then on Vishnu is eulogised as Trivikrama,tri- \n\t\t\tvi-kramathree, verily, paced - surpassing, one who surpasses all \n\t\t\tthe three worlds in three strides."

[1-37-28] It is said that each of the six Krittika-stars came forward to give her milk firstly \n\t\t\tto this boy. Observing their eagerness to feed him, Skanda / Kaartikeya made his \n\t\t\tone face into six and sucked all the milk of all the six stars and become an adolescent \n\t\t\tboy in day. Hence he looked like the one with six faces, by which he is calledShaNmukha, six-faced deity. Later he argues with his father Shiva that \n\t\t\the is superior to Shiva, because he has five-faces of Shiva, plus his own, totalling \n\t\t\tto a six, and he is a six-faced deity, superior to the five-faced god, namely \n\t\t\tShiva. In another way, the boy by birth is dextrous and he sucked the milk of \n\t\t\tall the six mothers in split second with one face, but it appeared to all deities \n\t\t\tthat the boy has been sucking milk with six faces, i.e., with rapid-face-movement. \n\t\t\tThus on establishing his ambidextrous personality, the gods nominate him as the \n\t\t\tChief of Celestial Army."

        "translation": "Discerning all of Ramayana in its actuality by his yogic prowess that highly intellectual \n\tValmiki pioneered to author all of the legend of Rama, for Rama is a delighter of all \n\tin all worlds, and whose legend is abounding with the real functional qualities of earthly \n\tpleasures and prosperities, and which clearly elaborates the meaning of probity and its \n\toperative qualities, and thus this legend is like an ocean replete with such gems called \n\tthoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well. [1-3-7, 8] Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans arepuruSaartha-s, in its axiological \n\tmeaning. Hindus have four suchpuruSaartha-s [namely human values,]dharmaprobityarthaprosperity,kaamapleasures, and finallymokSha, blessedness. Of these four only the first three,dharma, artha, kaamaare usually \n\treferred, and they are calledtri-varga. The final onemokShais not \n\toften quoted. Dhrama is the driving force.chodanaa lakShaNaartho dharmaH- Jaimini. \n\tHence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it \n\tdoes not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say 'categorical \n\timperative' of Kant. And the other two,artha, kaama, are the means of dharma, \n\tand all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured \n\ton thesepuruSaartha-s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts \n\tof richness and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its \n\tmain import is the virtuosity of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other \n\tless valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all \n\tthese peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody \n\tand heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is \n\tin accordance with all the scriptures."

But to \n\tsome commentators, as per the format of this chapter, which surveys what Valmiki has scheduled \n\tto write, it is unacceptable since the worduttareoccurs for only one occasion, \n\thence cannot mean next canto.

        "translation": "I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating \nhindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. [1-49-2] Indra is a position assigned to some high-souled being on acquiring considerable \nmerit. He functions as a CEO of the universe, maintaining seasons, rains, thunders, \nthunderbolts, crops, earthquakes, and every aspect of nature, whether they are good \nor bad for us. If any Vedic-ritual were performed, this Indra would be too happy, \nas he and his deputies like Rain-god, Fire-god, Air-god, et al., will receive many \noblations from that ritual. But if it istapas'the practise of asceticism, \npenance, or ascesis' by single sage, Indra will be highly perturbed. Usually sages \nwill be practising this ascesis for attainment of higher abodes of Brahma, Vishnu, \nor Shiva. Some practise this to overthrow present Indra and try ascending to his \nposition, or to attain immortality and thereby rout out Indra, as with the case \nof Ravana. When that practise is about to materialise, Indra sends his agents, like \nvoluptuous celestial beauties, namely the apsara-s, to infatuate those sages with \ntheir beauty. Once the sage's concentration fails, his practise becomes futile. \nThus, Indra retains his present position. Here, though Sage Gautama did not practise \nhis ascesis for Indra's post, Indra had to hinder it in his own apprehension, and \nwhen the fury of Gautama is incited, Gautama's practise also failed and he had to \nredo his ascesis until he overcomes his passions. Thus, this 'causing hindrance' \nis a divine-act as proclaimed by Indra to other gods. In doing such 'divine-acts' \nIndra will also be maligned, for which the higher gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, \nor other higher beings will come to his rescue."

The analogy she uses there is to differentiate between functionaries like the Vedic-scholar \nand the caste-bound Profaner [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites or any esoteric \nknowledge... but socially designated as a Cremator] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, \nand between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar, or a true \nBrahmin may perhaps conduct ayaj~nabut he is no authority to conductantyakriya'funerals' till its end. At best, a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps \nuntilkapaalamoksha'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of thiscaNDaalto take care of the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since \nleaving half burnt corpse to vultures and wolves is sinning as well as for unsanitary situations. Thus, \nif a Vedic scholar conductsjaataadi kriyaaH'rites from birth onwards...' as an initiator, \nthen acaNDaalconductsantya, uttarakriyaaH'rites of death afterwards...' as a \nterminator. This verbiage is to demark the relative values of functionaries, according to the maxim \n'a donkey is to bear and a dog is to bark...' and if their functions are reversed, reversed are our \nresults."

        "translation": "While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of\n  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. [1-67-16] A bow has a definite height and it is a measure of length, from the ages even\n  up to the age Kautilya, who gave many accounts for weights and measures, in his 'Artha Shaastra'\n  a Penguin re-publication. Fouraratni-scubits are onedhanu, a bow-length,\n  where onearatniis 18 inches, thus a bow-length is 6 feet and above, taking the\n  standard size of archer as a six-footer and a little above. The bow's height is the height of the\n  archer plus one measure of his head's height, as the upper end has to tower the archer's head.\n  That being so, this bow belongs to Shiva and its height must be placed more than the human\n  measure of 6 feet, and then it must be some 8 to 10 feet. And 'Rama is no crane-legged boy, as\n  hisphysique is said to be of 'medium' size, and then how a boy of, say of 4, 41/2 feet, could\n  catch the upper end of 8-10 feet bow to bend it...' is the objection. An archer has to stand the\n  bow on ground, clutch its lower end under big toe, and with one hand, he has to bend it, while\n  with the other he catches the bowstring to string the other end. He is not supposed to handle it\n  like a holdall or a briefcase. For this objection it is said in a way that the poet is using the\n  adjectivemahaatmaato Rama, ' an unfathomable one with an equally unfathomable soul...\n  inasmuch as his duty is concerned...' The minute he touched the bow, it became a spongy stick and\n  it listened to him and bent as he wished. Other way round, Rama is an ambidextrous archer and\n  furthered is his skill by his possession of some divine missiles as given by Vishvamitra. Hence,\n  his dexterity is now multiplied and he can handle any divine or human bow 'effortlessly...'"

Editor. \n\t\t\tIn its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is \"the traditional \n\t\t\tbirthplace of man for Jews, Christians and Muslims...\" On the other hand, \n\t\t\tHindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace \n\t\t\tof man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said \n\t\t\tto be the \"Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the \n\t\t\tthird millennium BC\". Further that \"To the east a similar florescence \n\t\t\toccurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys...\" This florescence in Indus \n\t\t\tValley and far eastward did not occur later to Mesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations \n\t\t\tbut flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the \n\t\t\teternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present \n\t\t\tworld, Bhuuloka, surrounding Meru Mountain and its geography includes the land \n\t\t\tunto Rome, Russia, China. We will refer to Meru mountain-oriented geography and \n\t\t\tits geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to \n\t\t\tBuddhism and Buddhism's westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana \n\t\t\tmust have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of \n\t\t\tMiddle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right \n\t\t\tfrom the days of Ramayana to Moses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries \n\t\t\tfrom where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since \n\t\t\thistory believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content \n\t\t\tcan not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Baahlika \n\t\t\tmay nearly mean Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed \n\t\t\thistoric countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanaayu, another \n\t\t\tcountry referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, \n\t\t\tadvent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication \n\t\t\tcalled Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments."

And if we say 'we are drained out by the dowry, wherefrom \nwe give royal presentations...' then he will spew fire on us saying 'you spend so much on dowry, can't you purchase its \nvelvet bag...' and thereafter a sermon follows about the dying Indian culture at the onslaught of westernisation, while \nhe starts throwing the packets ofnavadhaanyaetc., as though he is giving alms to the beggar. Though Janaka has \nnot purchased such a bag of dowry, he has some more problems with this marriage. A discussion on this is there at later \npart.

        "translation": " So Puraana-s are evolved to throw some light on what Vedas have to say, of course with some religious overtones. Elsewhere \nwe have detailed about Puraana-s of them Shiva and Vishnu Puraana-s are though prominent, but their adherers quarrel tooth \nand nail about the superiority of Shiva or Vishnu. In Vishnu Puraana many instances of coalescence of Vishnu with Shiva \nare narratedtvat vaakyagauravaat etat \nmayaa cakram nivartitam | tvayaa yat abhayam dattam tat datttam akhilam mayaa -Krishna says to Shiva \nat the time of eliminating a demon called Baana Asura, 'As you say I have taken back my disc, and if you give a boon I deem \nall that is given by me...' So many instances can be quoted like this. But here Parashu Rama has no intention to kill Dasharatha \nRama, as said in Padma Puraana:rarakSha bhagavaan - bhaargava \nraamaH - ekam ikShvaakostu mahaakulam | maataamahasya anvayatvaat reNukaavacanaat tathaa |'that god \nBhaargava Rama safeguarded one great dynasty of Ikshvaku-s, for they are related to his grandmother, besides at the request \nof Renuka Devi, his mother...' So, god Bhaargava Rama is a nepotist and saved Dasharatha Rama. Not so, Bhaargava Rama is \nneither a nepotist nor a god to be worshipped. He is not worshipped because his incarnation is not a full incarnation of \nVishnu as Dasharatha Rama. Only the wrathful impetuosity of Vishnu is incarnated like Bhaargava Rama to perform butchery \nand even infanticide.bhaargavo ati dR^iptaH prasiddhaH \ntadaaniim ca krodhaandha iti svakShatriyavadhaat upratam shastrasannyaasam ca parityajya capala iti viditaH'Bhaargava Rama is a highly impudent personality and blinded by his wrath, thus to eliminate his own Kshatriya-s [namely \nhis own relatives, Dasharatha and his sons; again the caste system is peeping in, isn't it!] On overstepping his pledge \nof renunciation of weaponry, he came... hence his actions are faltering...'appayaa diikshita, \na shaivaite.

[1-76-3] Up to here both these Rama-s are in close quarters with other few present there. After this dialogue, they have moved a \nlittle away from the throng and facing each other as true combatants. A swordsman or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length \nor bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing \nor listening. This scene has an analogy in Maha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, \nthat Krishna froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are aware of \nKrishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and has seen all with his wisdom-eye. \nHere we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over \nthe mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. \nFurther more, all the people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhaargava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, \nVashishta, Rama's brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners or seers do no harm \nin revealing Rama's godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana."

The above said 'distancing' \nof these two Rama-s has another purpose. Rama has certain innate nature of making his observers enchanted by his very personality. \nEven Ravana looks at him adoringly in the war scene. This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature \nof others, should he lay his hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, \nand say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu from Bhaargava \nRama, while snatching the bow from his hands. For this Padma Puraana says:iti uktvaa devii vaiShNavyaa shaktyaa tad \ngataayaa saha | jagraaha vaiShNavam caapam vinayena ca liilayaa ||'oh, Devi Parvati, saying so Rama took away the \nVishnu's anima from Bhaargava Rama, along with bow of Vishnu, sportily and obediently, too...'

An Indian bride, or the later time wife is supposed to not to call \nher husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, person-less, and numberless hooting, \ncooing or calling likee jii - o jii - emanDii - ennango - shuniyeso on. To cite one such ceremony it is 'naming \ngame.'

After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband's name, and then only she \nwill be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of \nreadymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... \nbecause, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained \nfour brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with 'beauty' \nas her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs \nhis affection to Rama, later."
