At the present \n\ntime the shore to shore distance between southern tip of India and Northern tip of Sri Lanka is around sixty miles. \n\nEven with a measure of 2.5 miles per yojana, hundred yojanas translate to 250 miles. To explain this anomaly, \n\nwe need to consider that around the time of Ramayana, the distance was lot more than the current sixty miles. \n\nThis is in sync with the current theories by geologists that the ocean between India and the current Sri Lanka \n\nhad been replaced by land mass over a period of time. Most of the land to the south of current Raghunatha Pura \n\nhad been covered by landmass in antiquity. Also according to Ramayana, the mountains Trikuta, Lamba and Suvela \n\nwere to the north of Lanka, but currently the mountains are found in the southern part of Lanka. This suggests \n\nthat the northern parts of current Lanka were submerged in water during the Ramayana period."
