Understanding how to do so effectively is a critical skill in a data-rich world.

Over two stimulating weeks, you will discover how best to visualise different data sets, and spot and avoid common pitfalls. </p>\n<p>People new to data and chart-making will gain a set of practical, foundational skills. Those who work with data regularly will benefit from tips on honing their data-storytelling skills and making simple but powerful data visualisations. Both groups will learn how to create a culture of data-led problem-solving, guided by <em>The Economist</em> \u2019s award-winning data journalists, and receive detailed feedback on their charts from course tutors. </p>\n<p>This is a foundational course for people who review, analyse or prepare reports and presentations using data, as well as those who want to use data in decision-making. It will benefit professionals looking to build their confidence in communicating insights from data to various audiences. It will also be valuable to those with analytics experience who would benefit from advice on visualising and presenting data. This course is designed for leaders, managers and decision-makers interested in learning practical techniques, as well as analysts and analytics managers who need to communicate specialist information and insights to an audience with persuasive power. </p>\n<p>This course does not provide detailed, technical instruction in complex visualisations such as videographics or the most intricate infographics.

        "tertiary_description": "<p>While algorithmic trading has been around for a long time, the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has substantially accelerated its course of development. This allows trading algorithms to find market efficiencies and better recognize profitable patterns of their own accord, making trades at a very high frequency. The performance of these algorithms, therefore, often exceeds those of professional traders and financial advisers. </p>\n<p>The Oxford Algorithmic Trading Programme from Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford, equips you with a comprehensive understanding of the rules that drive successful algorithmic trading strategies and hedge funds, as well as a grounded introduction to financial theory and behavioral finance. Over the course of six weeks, you\u2019ll learn four principles established by Programme Director Nir Vulkan to guide you through the process of evaluating an algorithmic trading model. You\u2019ll also discover what biases are present in the market and how these behavioral traits create exploitable patterns. On completion, you\u2019ll have the ability to assess whether a trading model or fund is worth investing in. </p>\n<p>This programme is aimed at working professionals in the trading and investment space or those not currently familiar with the algorithmic trading platform. It will be of value to anyone interested in hearing from industry leaders and top academics on the key issues facing algorithmic systematic traders. The programme will also interest professionals looking to learn about the predicted impact of AI and automation on the course of financial trading\u2019s future. Private and part-time traders who wish to improve their trading abilities and experiment with algorithmic trading models will also benefit from the programme. This non-technical programme features optional activities for participants interested in engaging in the technical side of algorithmic trading by discovering how to build a model using Python. These activities are entirely voluntary and run through an integrated development environment. No extra software is required.</p>",

This allows trading algorithms to find market efficiencies and better recognize profitable patterns of their own accord, making trades at a very high frequency. The performance of these algorithms, therefore, often exceeds those of professional traders and financial advisers. </p>\n<p>The Oxford Algorithmic Trading Programme from Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford, equips you with a comprehensive understanding of the rules that drive successful algorithmic trading strategies and hedge funds, as well as a grounded introduction to financial theory and behavioral finance. Over the course of six weeks, you\u2019ll learn four principles established by Programme Director Nir Vulkan to guide you through the process of evaluating an algorithmic trading model. You\u2019ll also discover what biases are present in the market and how these behavioral traits create exploitable patterns. On completion, you\u2019ll have the ability to assess whether a trading model or fund is worth investing in. </p>\n<p>This programme is aimed at working professionals in the trading and investment space or those not currently familiar with the algorithmic trading platform. It will be of value to anyone interested in hearing from industry leaders and top academics on the key issues facing algorithmic systematic traders. The programme will also interest professionals looking to learn about the predicted impact of AI and automation on the course of financial trading\u2019s future. Private and part-time traders who wish to improve their trading abilities and experiment with algorithmic trading models will also benefit from the programme. This non-technical programme features optional activities for participants interested in engaging in the technical side of algorithmic trading by discovering how to build a model using Python. These activities are entirely voluntary and run through an integrated development environment. No extra software is required.</p>",

Positive social, environmental, and behavioral factors can contribute towards a child thriving in later life. However, not all children are the same: each requires a unique approach, and it\u2019s imperative that the role of individual identity development within supportive environments is recognized. </p>\n<p>Study child psychology from this important perspective in the Child Development: Behavior and Mental Health online short course, designed by child development experts from the Stanford Center for Health Education (SCHE), part of Stanford Medicine. By capitalizing on each child\u2019s personal interests and motivations, you'll learn to create a space that fosters positive interactions and optimal learning. Over the course of six weeks, you\u2019ll look at practical, science-based approaches to encourage a child\u2019s innate learning abilities, and positive behavioral discipline techniques to prevent and address children acting out. You\u2019ll also explore the impact of parenting and grasp the importance of a child\u2019s social connection with adults and peers. Lastly, the course examines the steps you can take to support a child\u2019s mental health, in order to help them develop in a healthy and happy way.</p>\n<p>Professionals who engage with children, either in educational or healthcare contexts, will benefit from this practical, science-informed online course. These individuals will gain the techniques and knowledge to better support a child\u2019s development while working in roles within the medical or healthcare industry, such as physicians, pediatric specialists, therapists, and social workers. Those within child-related occupations, including teachers, parents, caregivers, and school counselors, will have the opportunity to study positive child-rearing approaches and key developmental milestones. All learners will walk away with a clear, in-depth understanding of how to support and encourage a child as they develop \u2014 socially, emotionally, and physically.</p>",

You\u2019ll also explore the impact of parenting and grasp the importance of a child\u2019s social connection with adults and peers. Lastly, the course examines the steps you can take to support a child\u2019s mental health, in order to help them develop in a healthy and happy way.</p>\n<p>Professionals who engage with children, either in educational or healthcare contexts, will benefit from this practical, science-informed online course. These individuals will gain the techniques and knowledge to better support a child\u2019s development while working in roles within the medical or healthcare industry, such as physicians, pediatric specialists, therapists, and social workers. Those within child-related occupations, including teachers, parents, caregivers, and school counselors, will have the opportunity to study positive child-rearing approaches and key developmental milestones. All learners will walk away with a clear, in-depth understanding of how to support and encourage a child as they develop \u2014 socially, emotionally, and physically.</p>",

On the Compliance Essentials course from the University of Cape Town (UCT), you'll learn the fundamental principles of compliance management, enabling you to assist in limiting liabilities and, ultimately, avoid the legal and financial repercussions of non-compliance. Designed by experts from UCT, this course uses the Generally Accepted Compliance Practice (GACP) framework and the King IV Code to provide you with the necessary principles and guidelines to work in this space. As you work through the modules, you\u2019ll develop the confidence to address potential issues and make recommendations to your team. You\u2019ll also explore the value, scope, and complexities of the role compliance plays in your business and within the broader legislative landscape. </p>\n<p>After completing this course, you\u2019ll receive a one-year student membership to the Compliance Institute Southern Africa (CISA). Should you complete both UCT compliance online short courses offered by GetSmarter, part of edX, within a one-year period, you\u2019ll then get a two-year CISA membership. </p>\n<p>The UCT Compliance Essentials online short course does not have entrance requirements and is aimed at those new to the world of compliance and legislation. Professionals looking to move into this key business function will gain the necessary skills and understanding to apply for a compliance position. For those whose position already requires them to work closely with compliance functions in their organization, it can provide the expertise to confidently make recommendations, perform risk analyses, and draft reports. Given the increasing demand for compliance literacy, developing your knowledge of this field may help facilitate career growth in a variety of industries.</p>",

You\u2019ll be introduced to Dynamic Work Design, a process improvement framework based on decades of industry practice and academic investigation.

The program explores the necessity of continuous change and the effectiveness of a dynamic approach to work design, while identifying opportunities for process improvement within your own business context. </p>\n<p>This program is suited to business leaders who are looking to design and improve processes and formulate strategy that drives progress. It's similarly beneficial to managers who are interested in optimizing efficiency and facilitating problem-solving in their teams.

However, this growing acknowledgement of sustainability\u2019s urgency has not always been supported by a deeper grasp of what it means or how it can be achieved. In the face of a rapidly changing climate and escalating pressure from all quarters, sustainability can no longer be viewed as a narrow box-ticking exercise. It demands a holistic understanding of the concepts underpinning it and a broad view of the politics, economics, and social factors that impact it.</p>\n<p>The Sustainability: Environment, Economy and Society online certificate course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) equips you with an integrated perspective of sustainability through a social-science lens. Over six weeks, you\u2019ll examine prevailing theoretical concepts in this space, and practically apply your learnings across a number of real-world scenarios. Guided by leading LSE academics, you\u2019ll investigate the multidimensional nature of sustainability today, exploring key areas such as sustainability transitions, sustainable economics, and social development. You\u2019ll also discover ways to navigate climate risk and preserve natural capital, all while developing strategies for financially viable sustainability in your own business context. At the end of the course, you\u2019ll have gained a toolkit for incorporating sustainability into your current or future role, and the knowledge needed to lead your organization towards a greener tomorrow.</p>\n<p>By breaking sustainability concepts down into digestible insights, this course offers participants of all professions and experience levels the tools needed to contribute to circular economy development. Executives, directors, and managers will benefit from its in-depth examination of sustainability strategy from a business perspective, while investors and finance professionals will gain the knowledge to identify and utilize socially responsible investments. Individuals who operate in the public sector \u2014 including government employees, policymakers, and nonprofit workers \u2014 will develop their understanding of how social development and sustainability interact, and learn to lead cross-sector initiatives. Risk managers and compliance officers will enhance their ability to identify and navigate climate-related challenges, and environmental specialists or program consultants will develop the vocabulary to link sustainability value to the business world. Anyone anticipating that sustainability will become a daily consideration in their work will gain the skills to \u2018hybridize\u2019 their role and participate ably in the green economy of the future.</p>",

It demands a holistic understanding of the concepts underpinning it and a broad view of the politics, economics, and social factors that impact it.</p>\n<p>The Sustainability: Environment, Economy and Society online certificate course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) equips you with an integrated perspective of sustainability through a social-science lens. Over six weeks, you\u2019ll examine prevailing theoretical concepts in this space, and practically apply your learnings across a number of real-world scenarios. Guided by leading LSE academics, you\u2019ll investigate the multidimensional nature of sustainability today, exploring key areas such as sustainability transitions, sustainable economics, and social development. You\u2019ll also discover ways to navigate climate risk and preserve natural capital, all while developing strategies for financially viable sustainability in your own business context. At the end of the course, you\u2019ll have gained a toolkit for incorporating sustainability into your current or future role, and the knowledge needed to lead your organization towards a greener tomorrow.</p>\n<p>By breaking sustainability concepts down into digestible insights, this course offers participants of all professions and experience levels the tools needed to contribute to circular economy development.

Risk managers and compliance officers will enhance their ability to identify and navigate climate-related challenges, and environmental specialists or program consultants will develop the vocabulary to link sustainability value to the business world. Anyone anticipating that sustainability will become a daily consideration in their work will gain the skills to \u2018hybridize\u2019 their role and participate ably in the green economy of the future.</p>",

        "tertiary_description": "<p>As the urgency for a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive (DEI) workplace heightens, companies and individuals are seeking tangible outcomes that not only demonstrate their commitment to DEI, but effectively turn dialogue into action. </p>\n<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace can\u2019t exclusively serve business value: it\u2019s an ethical imperative. In its capacity to foster innovation, creativity, and empathy, DEI achieves results in ways homogeneous environments rarely do. But it takes awareness, sensitivity, and collaborative effort to realize potential and to deliver on commitments to improve structural and social impediments to achieving an enriching, humane working environment. </p>\n<p>Gain the skills to lead and manage DEI initiatives in your workplace in the Leading Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion online short course from the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University. Over six weeks, you\u2019ll develop a holistic understanding of what DEI means for the modern business, and learn how certain initiatives can be executed to improve outcomes in your own context. Further develop your cultural competencies, and foster inclusivity to drive organizational value with insights from Professor Alvin B. Tillery, a thought leader in racial politics and presidential leadership. </p>\n<p>This course is designed for any professional interested in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, including those who lead diverse groups but may not recognize specific DEI concepts, and those with experience in DEI initiatives who may lack formal training in this field. </p>\n<p>Advisers and managers in the DEI space, and HR specialists, recruiters, and talent managers will gain a practical skill set for fostering inclusivity in their teams and companies. People managers and supervisors will learn how to harness practical leadership tools, communication strategies and metrics, and benefit from networking with a cohort of like-minded peers. Senior managers and C-suite executives will discover how best to diversify their workforce using the innovative CREED model, and find value in turning DEI initiatives into a strategic organizational priority. </p>\n<p>The course\u2019s learning outcomes have broad application across various industries, including corporates, government, nonprofits, and the wider public sector.</p>",

In its capacity to foster innovation, creativity, and empathy, DEI achieves results in ways homogeneous environments rarely do.

Over six weeks, you\u2019ll develop a holistic understanding of what DEI means for the modern business, and learn how certain initiatives can be executed to improve outcomes in your own context. Further develop your cultural competencies, and foster inclusivity to drive organizational value with insights from Professor Alvin B. Tillery, a thought leader in racial politics and presidential leadership. </p>\n<p>This course is designed for any professional interested in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, including those who lead diverse groups but may not recognize specific DEI concepts, and those with experience in DEI initiatives who may lack formal training in this field. </p>\n<p>Advisers and managers in the DEI space, and HR specialists, recruiters, and talent managers will gain a practical skill set for fostering inclusivity in their teams and companies. People managers and supervisors will learn how to harness practical leadership tools, communication strategies and metrics, and benefit from networking with a cohort of like-minded peers. Senior managers and C-suite executives will discover how best to diversify their workforce using the innovative CREED model, and find value in turning DEI initiatives into a strategic organizational priority. </p>\n<p>The course\u2019s learning outcomes have broad application across various industries, including corporates, government, nonprofits, and the wider public sector.</p>",

In a simple and stable environment, this approach may be effective, but today\u2019s business world is far from simple or stable. As the corporate landscape becomes more changeable and complex \u2014 with multicultural teams, hybrid working, competitive markets, faster product cycles, digitalization and AI \u2014 there is an urgent need for organizations and their leaders to become more agile and flexible in how they respond. They should pay attention to the context in which they operate, be ready to deploy a range of leadership approaches, and adapt as their business landscape changes. </p>\n<p>Based on years of research by the Program Directors, the Organizational Leadership: Driving Culture and Performance online program from the Institute for Management Development (IMD) is designed to enhance your impact as a leader. It explains how you can achieve this impact by improving and adapting the workplace environments you create for your business and teams. You\u2019ll be introduced to, and have the opportunity to create a Leadership Operating System (OS) built on the foundations of trust, clarity, and momentum. Over five weeks, you\u2019ll explore the elements of the Leadership OS and discover how to use it to motivate people and set the tone for organizational culture and performance. Walk away with your tailored Leadership OS action plan, ready to implement immediate changes in your own business. </p>\n<p>This program is aimed at leaders who want to prepare for, and become more effective in, directing and supporting others to achieve objectives. It would benefit anyone who manages people \u2014 regardless of industry or company size \u2014 who wants to help foster a better working environment, and a more resilient organization. Mid- to senior-level leaders will gain a new approach to maximize their impact on individuals, teams, and, in turn, overall performance. HR specialists, strategists, consultants, and aspiring leaders will learn how to prepare for the challenges of a more globalized, uncertain, and complex business landscape. This program is for all managers and executives who would like to enhance productivity, motivation, and innovation in a disrupted business world.</p>",

                "value": "<p>Traditional models of leadership tend to focus on how leaders should behave, assuming that these behaviors and tasks will lead to high performance and success, regardless of context. In a simple and stable environment, this approach may be effective, but today\u2019s business world is far from simple or stable. As the corporate landscape becomes more changeable and complex \u2014 with multicultural teams, hybrid working, competitive markets, faster product cycles, digitalization and AI \u2014 there is an urgent need for organizations and their leaders to become more agile and flexible in how they respond. They should pay attention to the context in which they operate, be ready to deploy a range of leadership approaches, and adapt as their business landscape changes. </p>\n<p>Based on years of research by the Program Directors, the Organizational Leadership: Driving Culture and Performance online program from the Institute for Management Development (IMD) is designed to enhance your impact as a leader. It explains how you can achieve this impact by improving and adapting the workplace environments you create for your business and teams. You\u2019ll be introduced to, and have the opportunity to create a Leadership Operating System (OS) built on the foundations of trust, clarity, and momentum. Over five weeks, you\u2019ll explore the elements of the Leadership OS and discover how to use it to motivate people and set the tone for organizational culture and performance. Walk away with your tailored Leadership OS action plan, ready to implement immediate changes in your own business. </p>\n<p>This program is aimed at leaders who want to prepare for, and become more effective in, directing and supporting others to achieve objectives. It would benefit anyone who manages people \u2014 regardless of industry or company size \u2014 who wants to help foster a better working environment, and a more resilient organization. Mid- to senior-level leaders will gain a new approach to maximize their impact on individuals, teams, and, in turn, overall performance. HR specialists, strategists, consultants, and aspiring leaders will learn how to prepare for the challenges of a more globalized, uncertain, and complex business landscape. This program is for all managers and executives who would like to enhance productivity, motivation, and innovation in a disrupted business world.</p>",

Although the conversation around women in leadership has increased in recent years, women continue to use male-normed management theories, and face unique challenges once in positions of power. </p>\n<p>The purpose of the Rotman Women in Leadership online program is to reveal and address these systemic barriers and empower women within business. Developed by the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, this six-week program delves into the historical and cultural constructs that have shaped belief systems of what it means to be a woman in the workplace. You\u2019ll gain development tools and communication skills to overcome barriers to success, and be exposed to a global and diverse cohort of fellow women leaders. </p>\n<p>The program analyzes the impact of gender stereotypes and focuses on building your leadership presence through non-verbal cues and emotional intelligence. You\u2019ll learn to overcome inner obstacles such as imposter syndrome and understand how an inner dialogue is produced and harnessed. Upon completion of the program, you\u2019ll have your own leadership plan, based on your personal goals and leadership vision. </p>\n<p>This program is applicable to women across industries, in business and government. It holds particular value to women who are currently in leadership and management positions, but will also benefit those who aspire to move into these roles. Women executives and managers will gain the opportunity to elevate their leadership skills, presence, and effectiveness. Aspiring leaders will have the chance to develop their leadership skills and take the next step in their career journey. Women who are looking to empower other women will gain more insight into gender inclusivity and how it\u2019s fostered in the workplace, and become more aware of internalized workplace challenges. </p>\n<p><em>While the program is designed for those who identify as women and non-binary professionals, those who identify as male are welcome as well.</em></p>",

Although the conversation around women in leadership has increased in recent years, women continue to use male-normed management theories, and face unique challenges once in positions of power. </p>\n<p>The purpose of the Rotman Women in Leadership online program is to reveal and address these systemic barriers and empower women within business. Developed by the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, this six-week program delves into the historical and cultural constructs that have shaped belief systems of what it means to be a woman in the workplace. You\u2019ll gain development tools and communication skills to overcome barriers to success, and be exposed to a global and diverse cohort of fellow women leaders. </p>\n<p>The program analyzes the impact of gender stereotypes and focuses on building your leadership presence through non-verbal cues and emotional intelligence. You\u2019ll learn to overcome inner obstacles such as imposter syndrome and understand how an inner dialogue is produced and harnessed. Upon completion of the program, you\u2019ll have your own leadership plan, based on your personal goals and leadership vision. </p>\n<p>This program is applicable to women across industries, in business and government. It holds particular value to women who are currently in leadership and management positions, but will also benefit those who aspire to move into these roles. Women executives and managers will gain the opportunity to elevate their leadership skills, presence, and effectiveness. Aspiring leaders will have the chance to develop their leadership skills and take the next step in their career journey. Women who are looking to empower other women will gain more insight into gender inclusivity and how it\u2019s fostered in the workplace, and become more aware of internalized workplace challenges. </p>\n<p><em>While the program is designed for those who identify as women and non-binary professionals, those who identify as male are welcome as well.</em></p>",
