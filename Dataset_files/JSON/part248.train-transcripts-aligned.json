And I was living with my girlfriend at the time. And I would jump on the bed and I would strike a karate pose. I'd never taken karate, but I had the books from Book Fair. And I would say, Abby-- that was my girlfriend-- there's a jackal in the room. And she got so used to it, she could talk me down while remaining asleep. She said, \"There's not a jackal in the room. Go to bed.\" And I would say, \"Are you sure?\" And she would say, \"Yes, Michael. Go to bed. There's no jackal.\" And I would say, \"OK.\" And I would go to bed knowing that there was a jackal. And that's trust.",
