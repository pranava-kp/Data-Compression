The movie features the cinematic debut of Evan's all-time favorite comic book superhero, the Black Panther. And he was worried that Chris, a total stranger, might witness him crying. I grabbed fate by the hand and convinced Evan to give up his plus one anyway. When I emailed Chris the good news, he wrote back that, quote, \"Hate may be too strong a word, but I really dislike the newest round of superhero movies.\" I didn't tell Evan about that, and we kept looking.",

She doesn't do fan mail. But she's looking at-- you know the page in certain magazines where they have the little pictures of the people who write for the magazine? She was looking at that, and she saw the photo of this writer who she liked. The picture was blurry, but he had this intense look in his eye. And you could tell he was smart and cute, both at the same time.",
