Today's program, \"Fear and Loathing in Homer and Rockville.\" We have two stories of places where people got really scared about immigrants, where immigration did not seem to be the main thing going on. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, Loathing. So the first half of our program was about a community that was worried about what might happen, theoretically, if undocumented immigrants arrived. This next story happens in a place where they actually already have arrived-- Rockville, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where this winter, something actually did happen. And the whole community had to deal with it. Zoe Chace explains.",

And she says what we're hearing on the school's voicemails is people's anger over this.",

I feel like a lot of times, in stories like this, the people trying to stop a potential suicide victim tiptoe around that person gingerly, careful not to make any sudden moves. Bob didn't do that. He didn't treat the guy like a potential victim. He treated him like a person, like anybody else calling into the show. And to be a person with someone who's about to cease being a person, that just takes an awful lot of nerve.",

For the entire 45 minutes, Bob is scrupulously honest about what he's doing. This is one of the few times in life where it would be more than forgivable to mislead someone, to just keep stringing them along to keep them on the phone. And Bob never does that. Because he never did that on the air. As always, he's just a naked heart speaking into the microphone, which, in this situation, that's the ultimate bet.",

And again, he could have said to the guy, \"Sure, I won't trace it,\" just to appease him. But Bob says that didn't seem right.",
