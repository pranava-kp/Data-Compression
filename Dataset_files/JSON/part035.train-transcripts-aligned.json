And it's very, very intimate and personal. And it's between me and God. And that made me feel, at that time, in my 22-year-old brain, like I was having a close relationship with a deity, which now I think is insane. But at the time, that all made sense to me.",

And I waited for him, for my father to come home. And he did. He came in the front door, walked over to my room. And he had this maniacal look on his face when he walked to my door. He looked at me. Then he looked at the other side of the room. And he saw weights there. He looked at me again. And I could tell, something's going on in that demented mind of his. And sure enough, he walks over to the weights, and he begins to disassemble them. They were cement weights that had plastic around them. And I have no clue what he's going to do. This is a new level of improvised savagery even for him.",

So what I did was, I pulled the knife out from underneath the pillow. I stood up. He said, \"Put it away, put it away.\" And I continued to stay there. He started walking at me. And I could tell-- he started demanding that I put it down, like, \"Put down the knife, put down the knife.\" And I lunged at him. And when I did, he put up his left arm. But I was able to stab him in the neck. And I came down hard. And I started twisting it, trying to break it off in his neck. And he screamed. And he grabbed his neck. And he said, \"You killed me. You killed me.\" And he fell to the ground.",

After Joe graduated from high school, he attended Bible college for a semester, but dropped out. He didn't want to work, so he supported himself by stealing from his friends. After a while, he moved on to bigger targets. He stole cars, passed fraudulent checks, and finally began robbing banks. In 1988, after being released from a two-year prison sentence, he went on a 14-month-long bank robbing spree.",

And they decided to work from 1:00 to 3:00 every day at the bank, get a little money in, so they could buy their stuff for ceramics or something. They would always greet me very cheerfully. And they were the easiest ones to rob. In fact, a couple times, I was embarrassed at the ease. I'd say, \"This is a robbery,\" to one woman. And she just looked down, opened the drawer, and started giving me the big bills first. I didn't have to finish my spiel. And I almost felt like, \"Hey lady, you do this any faster, they're going to think we were in cahoots.\"",

And Baros became enraged. \"You want a cigarette?\" Baros reportedly said. \"What kind of sucker do you think I am?\" Baca said Baros then started to call him names and threw two sugar dispensers at him. They shattered when they hit a wall. Baros also threw a salt and pepper shaker set and an ashtray, according to police reports. Baros then tried to hit Baca with a chair. Baros was arrested and faces charges of third degree assault and criminal mischief.",

Two juveniles mugged the Easter bunny at Georgia Square recently as he left the stage for a break. \"They came up to me, gave me a hug, and knocked my head back,\" said the battered bunny, a 19-year-old drama student at the University of Georgia. \"From what I was told, they were trying to take off the head,\" the bunny said. \"I experienced disorientation and a severe headache, resulting in a contusion.\" Police took a dim view of the incident. They rounded up two suspects, ages 12 and 13, and booked them on charges of simple battery. \"It's a sad day when the Easter bunny can't appear in public without a security escort,\" said police sergeant [? Mike Brenner ?].",

Don't tell anybody. The worst thing to do is tell your friends. Your sympathy, looking for sympathy. First thing you know, your friend is telling 68 people. And the first thing you know, 900 people know about you. You go over to a restaurant, say, 'Oh, you got arrested for shoplifting the other day, didn't you?'\" This way, I tell them, \"Don't even tell your mother. Don't tell your kids. Don't tell anybody.

They didn't allow me to have candy, so I took candy. They didn't allow me to wear my hair in a fancy style, so I took bobby pins. They didn't allow me to dress in a certain way. I couldn't have earrings. It was so easy to just go to the store, and whatever I wanted, I would just slip into a bag that I had with me. And then it began to be a question of I felt I could pull something off that other people couldn't do. And I felt very good about that. And then I began to be happy that I could get something for nothing. And that was great.",

But he chose, I have to say, the most difficult possible route to get there. He decided to hitchhike across the Sahara Desert. And not just hitchhike, but hitchhike using a remote route 1,000 miles long that most hitchhikers avoid. He brought no special gear, carried a small bag filled mostly with books, one change of clothes. He wanted to go to places on the map with fewer and fewer roads.",

They indicated that there was still a camel caravan that goes back and forth between southern Morocco and Timbuktu.

Why don't you buy this $300 worth of stuff?\" So it's like, \"Well, let me just make sure there's a caravan first.\"",
