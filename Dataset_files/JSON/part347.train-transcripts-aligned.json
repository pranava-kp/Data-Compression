People have gotten to know one another over the past four days of training. But once we took off our clothes and put on our costumes, everything changed. Ivy, the woman in charge of costuming, handed out our uniforms, and gave us a lecture on keeping things clean. She held up a calendar and said, \"Ladies, you know what this is. Use it. I have scraped enough blood out from the crotches of elf knickers to last me the rest of my life. And don't tell me, 'I don't wear underpants. I'm a dancer.' You're not a dancer. If you were a real dancer, you wouldn't be here. You're an elf, and you're going to wear panties like an elf.\"",

It's right on the tip of my mind where I can't get at it.\" Then they say their name. And you say, \"That's right. Van. You're Van. See, I didn't recognize you with that turtleneck. That's new, isn't it?\" And it's always new, because they grow so fast they are always needing larger clothes.",

And then he asks what they plan to leave him on Christmas Eve. And they say, cookies and milk. And he asks, what kind of cookies? And they say, chocolate chip, or whatever. And he demands the Photo Elf to say, \"Chocolate chip? That is Santa's favorite kind of cookie.\" I don't mind saying it, but I must have said it 60 times today.",

I'm supposed to stand around and say, \"Step on the magic star and you can see Santa.\" I said that for a while. And then I started saying, \"Step on the magic star and you can see Cher.\" And people got excited. So I said, \"Step on the magic star and you can see Mike Tyson.\" Some people in the other line, the line to sit on Santa's lap, got excited and cut through the gate so that they could stand on my magic star. Then they got angry when they looked through the Magic Window and saw Santa, rather than Cher or Mike Tyson.",

Tell Riley here that if he doesn't start behaving immediately, then Santa is going to change his mind and bring him coal for Christmas.\" I said that Santa changed his policy and no longer traffics in coal. Instead, if you're bad, he comes to your house and steals things. I told Riley that if he didn't behave himself, Santa was going to take away his TV and all his electrical appliances and leave him in the dark. All your appliances, Riley, including the refrigerator. Your food is going to spoil and smell bad. It is going to be so cold and dark where you are. You're going to wish you never even heard the name Santa.",

The children gathered around Santa and had their pictures taken. When Santa asked the 1o-year-old boy what he wanted for Christmas, his father shouted, \"A woman. Get him a woman, Santa.\" These men were very loud and irritating, constantly laughing and jostling one another. The two women sat on Santa's lap and had their pictures taken, and each asked Santa for a KitchenAid brand dishwasher and a decent winter coat.",

Most of the other elves are show business people, but several of them had real jobs at advertising agencies and brokerage firms. Bless their hearts. These people never in their wildest dreams figured there was a velvet costume waiting in their future. They are the really bitter elves. Most of the elves are young, high school and college students. They're young and they're cute, and one of the job perks is that I get to see these people in their underpants.",

By mid-afternoon, I was running into walls. By late afternoon, Snowball had cooled down. By the end of our shift, we were in the bathroom changing our clothes, and all of the sudden we were surrounded by five Santas and three other elves. All of them were guys that Snowball had been flirting with. Snowball just leads elves on, elves and Santas.",

During most days, there's a slow period when you sit around the house and talk to Santa. And most of them are nice guys, and we sit around and laugh. But Santa Santa takes himself a bit too seriously. I asked him where he lives, Brooklyn or Manhattan. And he said, \"Why, I live at the North Pole with Mrs. Claus.\" I asked what he does the rest of the year and he said, \"I make toys for all the children.\" Santa Santa sits and waves and jingles his bell sash when no one is there. He actually recited \"The Night Before Christmas,\" and it was just the two of us in the house. No children, just us. He says, \"Oh little elf, little elf. Straighten up those mantel toys for Santa.\" I reminded him that I have a name, Crumpet, and then I straightened up the stuffed animals. \"Oh little elf, little elf. Bring Santa a throat lozenge.\" So I brought him a lozenge.",

And then he asks them to name their favorite Christmas carol. Most of them say \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" Santa then asks if they'll sing it for him. The children are shy and don't want to sing out loud. So Santa Santa says, \"Oh little elf, little elf. Help young Brenda here sing that favorite carol of hers.\" Then I have to stand there and sing \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" which I hate.",

Santa Santa suggested \"Away in a Manger.\" The girl agreed to it but didn't want to sing because she didn't know the words. Santa Santa said, \"Oh little elf, little elf. Come sing 'Away in a Manger' for us.\" It didn't seem fair that I should have to solo. So I told Santa that I didn't know the words. Santa Santa said, \"Of course you know the words. Come now. Sing.\" So I sang it the way Billie Holiday might have sang if she had put out a Christmas album.",

The parents had planned to send these pictures as cards or store them away until the child is grown and can lie, claiming to remember the experience. Tonight I saw a woman slap and shake her crying child. She yelled, \"Rachel, get on that man's lap and smile, or I'll give you something to cry about.\" Then she sat Rachel on Santa's lap, and I took the picture, which supposedly means, on paper, that everything is exactly the way it's supposed to be, that everything is snowy and wonderful. It's not about the child or Santa or Christmas or anything, but the parents' idea of a world they can not make work for them.",

The subjects of the windows? Frank Sinatra, the beat poets, great blonds of the 20th century, Martin Luther King, and Sigmund Freud.",

I say, \"Center.\" She responds, \"Of attention.\" I ask her her dreams and aspirations for this, the coming 11th year of her life. \"To make another feature and to have my role on One Life to Live continue.\" She sells every word she says to me, smiling with both sets of teeth, her gem-like eyes glittering. She might as well be saying, \"crunchy\" the entire time. But she is charming. I experience extreme countertransference.",

It's too humiliating and too boring. My patients are all people I know. Perhaps it's because the couch faces away from both the street and myself that the sessions are surprisingly intimate. But it's more than that. The window is, weirdly enough, very cozy, more like a children's hideaway than a fish bowl. Patients seemed to relax immediately upon lying down.",

People from newspapers and television are asking me deep questions about the holiday, the nature of alienation at this time of year, things like that, as though I actually was Freud. It's disconcerting because, with very little effort, I could be drunk with the power. But it also points out the O. Henry \"Gift of the Magi\" quality of it all. The media is so desperate for any departure from the usual holiday stories they have to turn out, they come flocking. And yet, the public doesn't really even want to read about the holiday in the first place. It's like trying to jazz up a meal nobody wants to eat anyway.",

I can sit there unmindful of the crush in the aisles of the store, the hour badly spent over gifts thoughtlessly and desperately bought. As I sit there I hear the songs that play for the display one window over, the blonds of the 20th century. Doris Day singing \"Once I Had a Secret Love.\" Mae West singing \"My Old Flame.\" Marlene Dietrich singing \"Falling in Love Again. As I listen, I feel that they're really referring to my window, to Freud. Every time they come up on the repeating tape, I find them almost unbearably poignant, with all their talk of clandestine love, erotic fixation, and painfully hidden romantic agenda.",

I was so obsessed with sci-fi and fantasy that, at my 12th birthday party, I was pulled off the roller rink for reading the sci-fi book I had just unwrapped while roller skating. I read Ursula Le Guin, and Ray Bradbury, and Harry Harrison, and Harlan Ellison, and Larry Niven, and Robert Heinlein. But at 12, the author I loved above all others was Piers Anthony, who cranked out four books a year filled with heroic adventures, goofy puns, wise-cracking ogres and sexy cyborgs. I loved all of it.",
