I didn't know he was doing that, and we probably wouldn't have allowed it. So for the judges' information, we're going to have Mike Huell go before Clark Davis, because Mike's singing and Clark's dancing. So we can let the stage dry for a minute.",

There's a prank where O.J. pretends to be having an affair with another man's wife, and the man gets really angry.

He's not performing for an audience. And a warning-- this is a suicidal person talking at length about wanting to kill himself.",

And although nothing is more tedious than people sitting around theorizing about what is funny, it's interesting to see somebody get super brass tacks about this and try to actually define this thing that our whole program is about today. These researchers had over 1,000 people rate how funny some joke tweets about Hurricane Sandy were at different points in time. And before the hurricane hit land, people thought the tweets were funny. And then, unsurprisingly, while the hurricane was destroying homes, and knocking out power, and killing people, and in the immediate aftermath of all that, the tweets did not seem funny and in fact seemed kind of offensive.",

And some day, I was going to have to figure out how to teach her about puberty.
