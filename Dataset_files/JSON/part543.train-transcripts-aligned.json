Mrs. Clark said she had 11, as well. Mrs. Bagnato had nine. But Mrs. Kenny and Mrs. Clark didn't walk away with the prize that easily.

He recounted his physical violence with her, admitted to giving her a black eye and busting down the door to her house, and to the contract he drew up.

And in fact, the lawyers regularly threw in crude jokes during the trial, soliciting giggles from the audience.",

She continued having more kids, even took in an orphan from off the street. It's true that the chaos of the Stork Derby turned her into a laughingstock, and rocked Toronto for over a decade.

And then at one point, he realizes, oh man, I'm first. Now you'd think being in first place is a good thing. But for the majority of a bike race, competitors play hot potato with the top spot.
