He's got a satellite dish, and he's always bragging about how clear the reception is, and all these great channels. He can get like David Letterman on LA Times, so his life's great.

He says, \"No,\" but that he would scan through and see if he indeed got it. But of course he didn't.",

When I said \"hi\" back, she laid into me for not pruning a huge fir tree whose branches were hanging into her yard. \"It's blocking all the light in my house,\" she said, shaking her head. Then she got a little nicer and told me that the people who lived in my house in the '60s planted their Christmas tree one year, and it turned into that monster. I apologize about the overhanging branches, but the tree is over 25 feet tall, and I couldn't do it myself. I couldn't afford to pay someone, so I never did anything about it.",

I make a batch of chicken soup, put it in a Tupperware, and spend most of the day trying to find the perfect time to bring it over, ideally when Lil' Mo is not out front, which is hardly ever. I have to admit, part of me hopes that if I bring her soup, maybe he'll stop calling me \"hater.\" I try switching on the monitor to see if he's planning on going anywhere, but all I get is a bit of political poetry from the pirate radio station.",

At least I think that's what he says. I'm not really sure what he wants me to do. Did he just say, \"Touch the cooler?\" I stand there for a second, and then he tells me that's what they say in New Orleans, where he's from. It means, \"grab a beer.\" I really want to accept his offer, but its 10:00 in the morning.",

Mo leaned his head in and nodded to the lasagna on top of the dresser and said, \"So what is that?\" \"Lasagna,\" I say. \"Meat lasagna?\" \"Yeah, meat lasagna.\"",

Lil' Mo is there on the phone, and I run to switch on the baby monitor. Where is it? I can't find it. I call my husband's cell phone and ask where the monitor is. He says he put it in the storage closet because the baby's sleeping fine. He didn't think we really needed it anymore. I grab it, plug it in, and get a bunch of static from the police radios. Of course we need it.",

They say their Association discourages the use of mystery shopping for punishing or firing workers. It's a tool meant for training, they say, to help employees improve. Either way, Lynn has no qualms about doing it. She seems honestly surprised when I suggest there's something deceitful or unfair about watching strangers without their knowledge and then evaluating their work.",

Turns out the guy's coworker, who was competing with him for a promotion, was watching him make personal calls to his girlfriend and reporting each and every one of them-- date, time, and length-- to the boss. Occasionally Kevin himself becomes a player in the corporate schemes he's uncovering.",
