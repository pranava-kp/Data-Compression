Then, there's the magazine I read. This magazine has the most downbeat name of any magazine since DownBeat. It is called Living  Without. Living Without bills itself as a lifestyle guide for people with allergies and food sensitivities, which sounds straightforward enough. But the name Living  Without is so depressing, so forlorn, such a belligerent refusal to accentuate the positive, that I don't know why its publishers don't just come clean and call it Loser.",

When I asked Nick about it later, he said, \"A banana instead of toast? Why not ask for anything, then, anything of a similar monetary value to toast, like a cassette tape?\"",

Once a week, family night in their household was called pizza night. And they would all go out for pizza, until young Alec was diagnosed. They thought pizza night was history, until the mother finally figured out that she could just bring gluten-free dough to the pizzeria. All happy endings in Living Without are like this. Even the triumphs involve minor indignities like schlepping your own crust in tinfoil when going out for dinner.",

And it would also feel less true. There's nothing dignified about being allergic to wheat. It's the kind of annoying, specific, picky food nuisance you can only really talk about with the one person on earth who truly gives a hoot what kind of cracker you'd prefer, your mom. The corniness of Living Without is so comforting because it feels so maternal, as if it's written by a gaggle of friendly, Midwestern mothers, whose warm, cheerful kitchens smell like fresh-baked bread, fresh-baked bread made out of rice flour and potato starch.",

It's like what Jean Valjean experienced in the 1935 version of the film Les Miserables with Fredric March as Jean Valjean.

And when he's finally shown the room where he's going to get to stay when it's time for him to go to sleep, he looks at the bed.",

She's being monitored,\" he says. \"We will look for a donor, but there's a long waiting list.\"",

And the circle of daylight above me grows smaller and smaller and smaller, until it is a tiny white bird swooping and fluttering against a vast night sky. How does it feel to have no heart? It feels light, hollow, rattly. Something huge is missing. It leaves an ache, like the ghost of a severed limb. I'm so light inside, but so heavy on the outside, like gravity increased a hundredfold, gravity holding me to the bed like the ropes and pegs of a thousand Lilliputians.",

I don't think so. So who's really silly?",
