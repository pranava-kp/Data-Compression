Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of \nthe sun, such sage's hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity \nis inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. \n[4-11-85, 86] The name Agastya is derived from a famous act of this Sage. Mt. Meru is the highest peak on earth. By \nits nature it grows day by day, and stands first to be saluted by the rising sun in east every day. \nJealous of this Mt. Meru, Mt. Vindhya started to rise to exceed the height of Mt. Meru, thus obstructing \nthe sun's path. Then the day changed for night and the travel of Sun and Moon, the performance of Vedic \nrituals, which are bound by the solar lunar movement, went topsy-turvy. Then the gods prayed Agastya \nto do something to decrease the height of Mt. Meru. Agastya and his wife then were coming to Mt. Vindhya \nand seeing its height, he requested Mt. Vindhya, \"Oh, Mountain King Vindhya, myself and my wife are \ngoing southward, and we are not able to climb this much height... kindly lower yourself, so that we \nold people climb you and go to the other side...\" Mt. Vindhya being an ardent worshipper of sages and \nsaints immediately lowered his height to the ground level, so that the old couple need not climb but \njust walk over him. Agastya and his wife on coming to the southern side of the mountain again requested \nMt. Vindhya to be at this height only, for they will be returning soon to north. Mt. Vindhya readily \nagreed for that also, and it is lying like that even today. Because Agastya did not return to north \non coming to south Mt. Vindhya is still believed to be at ground level. Thus the solar and lunar movement, \nseasons' revolve, Vedic calendars etc. are again put to normalcy. Thus the name Agastya,aga sthamountain, stopper,agam sthaasyatior,stabhnaati iti agastyaH. He played an important \nrole in uplifting southern regions of India, namely Dravidian cultures. Hid wife is Lopaamudra, the \nsaintly lady will be quoted in Lalitha Sahasra Naamaavali. The thousand name of Mother Universe."

Further there is a method described indhanurvedaas to how a bowstring is to be fastened to the other end of the bow. The Indian mythological bows are of six feet or two \nyards, in height. It is also a measure like horse length. The string, which so far is spiralled to the bow beam, is to be \nremoved. Then the bottom end of the bow is to be kept pressed onto the ground with left foot's big toe. Then with the right \nhand the edge of the string is handled and with left hand the other end of the bow is to be held and crouched, so that the \nstring can be hooked or fastened there. After fastening, the stretch of the string is to be tested [like the occasional \ntesting of the badminton or tennis racquet for the tension of its gut,] by pulling and leaving it, so that it makes a warring \nsound. By this sound of the bowstring, which is a signal to the opponent, the opponent comes to know as to who is handling \nwhich bow. Then if the archer is going to beam out an arrow, he shall pull the arrow on the bowstring up to his right ear \nand leave it,aakarNaanta prayoga. Here, removing the bowstring from its fastening implies that this archer, namely \nRama who is so far handling the stringed bow, for he is roaming in forests, and since he is entering the place of elderly \nsaints now, unfastened the bowstring in all his humbleness to sages and saints."

[3-24-15] This episode of sending away Seetha and Lakshmana has got three reasons in the complex of She-He-Me. \n1] One is that this Seetha is to be sent away from that prospective battlefield, because Seetha is untrained \nfor warfare like Rama's third mother Kaikeyi. Secondly, whenever Seetha is present we see no killings \nor slayings in Ramayana, because she, as Goddess Lakshmi, condones any sinner and accords salvation. \nAs such, there may be a probability of not only hindering war, but there may be her blessing to every \ndemon with a free passage to heaven, of which Rama becomes a helpless onlooker. 2] Second reason is \nthat this Lakshmana is intolerant of any assault on his brother or sister-in-law and colloids head-on \nwith the aggressors, which may lead Lakshmana up to Lanka to confront even Ravana. That being the snakily \naggressive nature of Lakshmana, Rama bids him to go away before any happening, or any further dialogue \nis given to Lakshmana. 3] Third is that Rama is the first one to promise the sages and saints to eradicate \ndemons for himself, for which Seetha nags him not to wage a causeless war. Therefore, if Rama is going \nto hide in any cave camouflaged by trees along with Seetha, and Lakshmana goes on warring, the very \ncharacter of Rama is at stake. Thus, as promised to sages and saints Rama alone wanted to trigger off \nthe elimination process of demons. That is why Rama breathes fresh air saying \"good riddance\" in next \nverse."

Again Rama weighed the agony in\n  terms of his father's death and grabbing away of his kingdom. Raajya Lakshmi, Kingdom Wealth is\n  nothing before his wife, Wealth of Fortune, i.e. Bhaagya Lakshmi. Hence Rama is more bothered\n  about his fortune wife than the retrievable kingdom, or the death of an aged father."

[3-43-22, 23a] According to this original text, Rama is more lured by the Golden Deer than Seetha, whereas later legends \nmade Seetha a scapegoat. Rama too did not fancifully come under the lure but he got his own logistics \nto fall after the deer, which we come across in the following speeches of Rama. The word api 'even,' \nis a normal metrical filler at most times, but assumes importance at times. Here Rama is the all knowing \nand all deciding personality as depicted until now, and 'even' he is lured by the deer, say Maareecha's \nsupernal trickery."

[3-49-40] Nobility will not seek help selfishly; if help is sought that way, the seeker instantly becomes an ignoble, \nfalling from the heights of personal nobility. Seetha may be an impetuous lady but if she talking to \na noble elderly person or being, she talks judiciously in all her humbleness. Here she is not asking \nJatayu to wage a war against Ravana to save her. She is asking Jatayu to convey the news of her abduction \nto Rama, because as an old eagle, as old as her father-in-law, Jatayu may not fight back this Ravana \nsuccessfully. Besides, Ravana is with weaponry and a cunning warrior. Jatayu may be a powerful eagle, \nbut if it comes to weapons and missiles, a natural being cannot withstand the artificial ammunition \nof war. Hence, visualising the danger in Jatayu's attempting any combat with Ravana, she is asking him \nto be the carrier of news, as all the trees, river and her birds, sylvan deities, and the other birds \nand animals are not heedful of her request, and this eagle alone is beheld, besides being an old acquaintance."

To name a few, they areuraga, garuda, gandharva, kimpurusha, siddha, saadhya, vidyaadhara, \nchaaraNa, apsara, yaksha, guhyaka, bhuuta, khecharaand the like. Of them gandharva-s are amiable beings for their \nexpertise in performing arts. The apsara beings are the divine courtesans and among them are four apsara beings of high \norder. They areRambha, Urvashi, Menaka and Tilottama. These four are instrumental to Indra, to incite and allure \nsages from their austere penance, lest they may win over the ship on heavens from Indra. The present gandharva, namely Tumburu, \nin his courting with Rambha had belated his services to Kubera, the Chief Divinity for Wealth Management. Hence Kubera cursed \nthis gandharva to become the demon called Viradha, but yet this Tumburu alias Viradha is the devotee of Goddess Lakshmi. \nThe antagonists of sura are a-sura beings and all sorts of demons, monsters, etc., come under this category and they are \nnot devils or Satan's stooges, but they equal the capabilities of sura beings. Prof. Ranade observes that \"Dr. R.G. Bhandarkar, \nin an important article in the B.Br.A.S. Journal makes the following interesting suggestion. The Sanskrit equivalent of \nthe word demon viz., 'Asurya' may here refer to the 'Assyrian' country.

        "translation": "Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on \nin that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon. [3-4-34] The simile of sun and moon is of some importance. It will not be clear as to, who is compared with Sun and who with Moon, \nunless some ancient commentaries are touched. Rama is compared with Chandra, the Moon, because, Moon will not travel without \nhis wives. All the celestial stars are the wives of the Moon, and they twinkle before the Moon's arrival, in order to welcome \nhim into the night. Hence Rama is suffixed with Chandra, compounding to Sri Ramachandra. On the other hand, Sun does not \ntravel along with his wife, namely Chaya, the Shadow, but she always will be at his hind. We the living beings are in between \nthe Sun and his wife Chaya. If we face Sun in the morning times, she will be at our back, and in the evenings, when the \nSun is at our back, Chaya, shadow will be in front of us, reminding us of our lengthening shadow of life. Thus we are in \nbetween the light and shadow. The Sun is also called karma saakshi, [Witness of Deeds.] Our own shadow, shortens with the \nascending Sun and lengthens as the dusk of our day or life increases. Hence Sun's travel is wife-less one, and Lakshmana \nis thus compared with the Sun, for he does not have his wife travelling with him now. And Lakshmana is another karma saakshi \n[Witness of Events] in the Ramayana. In another way of commenting it is said that both of them are said to be moon-like \nin their appeasing personalities and sun-like in their radiant valour."
