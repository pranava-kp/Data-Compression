So if a dealer or a floor person heard someone say, how am I going to feed my kids, or I just lost my house, they were supposed to call over the ambassador, who would then give the player some addiction literature-- Kunder remembers a pamphlet called When the Fun Stops-- and a phone number to call. But in practice, Kunder says, it didn't happen. The only exception, he said, was if someone was suicidal.",
