[4-18-43] When it is said by Rama that 'today only I will kill Vali...' then it may be countered by saying, 'then \nwhy killing him from distance, why not confront him?' If Rama comes to fore, fear may grip Vali, then \nhe may take Ruma, Sugreeva's wife, and to insult, Sugreeva further, Vali may go to a distant place with \nher. Or, he may seek shelter with Ravana. Or, he may even take refuge in Rama like Sugreeva. Or, on \nseeing Sugreeva with enough support, he may summon all his Vanara army to fight with Sugreeva and his \nsupporters. Then it will prolong for a time. Then the promise of Rama made to Sugreeva to accord his \nwife and his kingdom by killing Vali, also prolongs. Justice delayed is denied. Otherwise, if Vali surrenders \nto Rama, as the killing of a refugee is not a merited act, Rama has to pardon Vali. Whether Vali takes \nrefuse or not, killing Vali on that day itself, and establishing Sugreeva in Kishkindha are the promises \nmade by Rama, at the time of befriending Sugreeva. The word given is to be kept up. So Rama did it and \nthere is no unrighteous deed done by Rama. And Vali also accepts this in the coming stanzas."

His argument \nwith Tara at the start of 16th chapter details this. He asks Tara, 'If Rama is a virtue-knower and a \ndiligent one, how then he can sin, in killing me?' Vali, unlike Ravana, never goes to a duel unless \nprovoked. Vali being a wilful combatant and Sugreeva is coming for a second time with the support of \nRama, he wanted to defeat that unknown Rama, along with suppressing Sugreeva's trivial pride. Vali promises \nTara that he is not going to kill Sugreeva, but wanted to take him to task. On coming to field Rama \nis not evident.

[4-1-28, 29a] Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that \"Translations are always \nbound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along...\" So also Ramayana, \nwhose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. Much can be said in \nKishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. \nThe hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are \nsufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, Manmadha, unlike his European counterpart \nCupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva \nHimself. But Shiva makes the Love-god Manmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of \nLove God's wife Rati. Hence Love God is also calledan anga= without, body. The bodiless nature \nand only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused \nbyanangaor Manmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word Manmadha not necessarily be taken \nas a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning.mann; manas; \nmadhaH - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaH...to churn. There is a platform calledmanas, below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory \norgans, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious \nlevel. Amara Kosha defines it ascittantu ceto hR^idayam svaantam hR^in maanasam manaH || dhii vargaand \nthe separation ischittam, chetaH, hridayam, svaantam, hrit, maanasam, manHand this is not \nthe composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. \nHence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, \nbut for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, \nRama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged \nin Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. \nIn the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi \nand roams over to find Her. It is the same situation innarasimhaincarnation. Goddess Lakshmi \nis a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and \nretrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava aagama \ntext Lakshmi states that:aham naaraayanii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa\" I am indeed \nNaaraayanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu...\" [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may \nnot be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint."

Vishnu slits that demon's throat\nwith his disc. Then that Rahu became a two-piece entity, one with head, named as Raahu and the\nother with trunk - tail, named as Ketu. Because Sun and Moon reported the wrongdoing of this\ntwo-piece entity, that entity prays to subsist on eating away Sun and Moon. That prayer is granted\nsubject to condition, that this eating will be done only occasionally. Those are the occasions of\neclipses of either Sun or Moon.

[4-29-33] Here it is said that Sugreeva re-entered his palace-chambers. This is due to the impulsive nature towards his \nsensual gratifications. He should have realised that he shall approach Rama to report the arrangements made, or \nat least he should have asked Hanuma to inform Rama about these orders to Niila. Without doing either of them, \nhe re-entered the palace-chambers by which Hanuma has landed into a dilemma. Hanuma cannot go to Rama on his own \nfor he is a minister of Sugreeva and inform about the orders of Sugreeva to Niila without the permission of the \nking, namely Sugreeva, nor as a minister, he can persuade Sugreeva to go to Rama to report the actions taken by \nmonkey forces to search Seetha. In reality, monkey forces are being gathered, but that information is not passed \non to Rama. This communication gap creates a furious emotion in Rama and he bids Lakshmana to go to Kishkindha \nand take Sugreeva to task, and even Lakshmana jumps on Sugreeva like a firebrand, in the coming chapters."

The ancient commentators take \nthis as many hands, more than two, as opposite to other dual numbered wording. For this it is said \nthat since Lakshmana is a right hand to Rama, Hanuma sees a three-handed god in Rama. But Hanuma is \ntalking to both Rama and Lakshmana; there shall be two deities with two hands each. The accepted \nphenomenon is that, Hanuma as a true devotee has seen the fourhanded Vishnu in Rama. This is \naccording to Govindaraja. Next, the arms of Rama are of protective nature to the friendly ones.aayaataaH, lengthily ones - they can be stretched to any extent, and on the other hand, \nanything can depend on them, as inyopaam aayatanam veda...and this su vrittaaH, round \nlike the serpent's hoods, or body builder's clubs, is to tell that no one can near them. Thus, the \nspherical universe can depend on the spherical shoulders of Rama. Thus Hanuma is reminding Rama of \nhis wild-boar incarnation where the whole world is lifted on his snout from waters. The wordparighaH, is to say that those spherical shoulders can remove difficulties of those who adore \nthem. TheparighaHin simple terms means, clubs, bludgeon, or ancient dumbbell unlike the \npresent day dumbbells of gym, but the word is deciphered to bepari ghafully, removing, or \nfully, falling to one's lot. That is, here these shoulders are mighty to eliminate Vali and these \nhands if shook by Sugreeva in friendship, Sugreeva's miseries will be removed completely."

[4-3-19b, 20] A monkey cannot be teased this far, for it will show its teeth, if exceeded. Hanuma is vexed with their \nsilence. So far he has been talking all flattering words, which he has drawn from many scriptures, i.e., \nscriptures. Their apparels and hair tufts are like those of sages and hermits, along with their self-contradictory \nresemblance as would-have-been emperors, and their mighty weaponry, and every other thing he said are \nthe quotes from lakshana shaatra, the scripture that prescribes the qualities of great emperors. This \nis what the other two listeners are assessing about the questioner also. In the midst of this unpopulated \nthick forest, some ascetic comes in, talks at length, that too without offence to the scriptures, is \nthe doubt of those two brothers. This particular questioner is not definitely any ascetic or sage, because \nhe is roaming in deep forests, rather than around some villages where he may get some charities. And \nalso that, generally ascetics will talk, only when they are talked to, but this one with some purpose \nbehind, is almost pestering to reveal the identity of the intruders. Hence the brothers took Hanuma \nto be another demon or anyone sent by somebody, for they already knew about the Vali-Sugreeva episode. \nApart from this, Rama is following his own Imperial protocol of assessing the person approaching on \nhis own, who is talking like this one, and who has high knowledge of all the scriptures. This analysis, \nRama gives to Lakshmana after a few more verses. For now, Hanuma had to yield to high resistance from \nthose two brothers, and is going to reveal himself, with a come-what-may attitude."

[4-3-28] From hereon Rama's analysis of Hanuma is depicted. In Rig Veda every letter has too many \nphonetically deflected variations, in many ways to mean many things. It is practically impossible to \ncontain that knowledge, unless the recitalist has complete control over it. Hence the word,viniita, 'well trained' is used. In Yajurveda manyanuvaaka-s or passages occur \nrecursively, with different utilisation. Remembering not to mix one with the other is a difficult \nprocess. Hence the recitalist has to have enormous remembrance. In Saamaveda the pitch and duration \nof the rendering is of high importance, as such it requires a scholarly bent to control vocal notes. \nThe three words,vinaya, schooling;dhaaraNa, remembrance andvedanaknowledge are required to each of the above Veda-s. Atharva Veda, on the other hand, has no recital \nperformance other than the above. Hence, it is said, is not quoted by Rama. Hanuma said 'you two are \neligible to rule the earth' as at 4-3-15, which tantamount to the quotebrhamaa vaa idam ekaeva \nagra aasiit...from Rigveda aitereya. Next he said that you are deities inhuman form at 4-3-13, \nwhich has its bearing on the Yajurveda quoteajaayamaano bahudhaa vijaayate...Then Rama is \nsaid having lotus-petal like eyes, at 4-3-11, taking clue from cChandogya of Saamaveda,myathaakapyaasam punDariikam evaakshiNii.... Hence these utterances of Hanuman are said to have \ndirect base in the Veda-s."

Without the knowledge of subsidiary scriptures of Veda-s, like,vyaakarana, nirukta, sikhsha,chandas, the study of Vedas and its ancillaries itself is futile. \nReading and reciting the Vedic hymns is of no use in practical life, for the knowledge learnt \nthereon is to be implemented in society.

[4-43-62]- - - .The Problem of Mapping and Dating RamayanaOn seeing the names like thisYavana, \nShakaetc., some hold the view that Ramayana was written more later to Greek's invasion on India. Max Muller \nin his 'What Can India Teach Us?' says: 'If I call the invasion which is generally called the invasion of the \nShakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians, orTurushkas, the Turanian invasion... \nwho took possession of India, from about first century BC to the third century BC.' Again classifying Sanskrit \nliterature he says, 'we divide the whole of the Sanskrit literature into there two periods, one anterior to the \ngreat Turanian invasion, the other posterior to it, we may call the former period as ancient and natural, that \nof the later modern and artificial.' Thus, Ramayana belonged to the modern and artificial literary period and \nVeda-s to ancient. According to Indians theTurushkasare not the Scythians but Turkish, \nand theYavanas,are clearly the Greek. Michelson in his 'Linguistic Archaisms of \nthe Ramayana...'adds another phase called Epical period. Thus, there are three, Vedic, Epical, and the rest of \nit is modern and artificial. At the same time Max Muller says: 'At the time of Solomon, there was a channel of \ncommunication open between India and Syria and Palestine is established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit \nwords which occur in the Bible such as ivory, apes, peacock, and sandalwood, which, taken together, could not \nhave been exported from any country but India...' So Solomon, Bible, Turanian invasion, Ramayana... all occasioned \nat one time, i.e., around 0 BC. So many professors, so many researchers have not said a date agreeable to Indians \nas well as to the world.At one place, it is said that there was a rapport among \nthese places India-Syria-Palestine and even up to Egypt, but at other place, the Indian thought, that the Indian \nhad Greeks and Greeks had Indians, is dismissed. What prevents to agree that both hold up mirror to almost the \nsame culture, though diverse in its practise, right from the belief of Greeks, viz., 'the sense of many gods are \nthere near at hand' to various gods, to their names, to the epical literature, and also to myths and legends and \ndramas etc, is unknown. But when it comes to dating and mapping 'the earliest date known for certain in Indian \nhistory is the invasion of Alexander in 326 BC...' and 'The chronology has been built up form the identification \nof Sandracrottus of Greek writers with Chandragupta Maurya... yet it is said 'In the seventh century BC India \nwas divided into sixteenMahajanapada-s...'as per 'An Historical \nAtlas of Indian Peninsula\", Oxford. Peculiarly those sixteen Janapada-s did not contain the names of Yavana, Shaka \nprovinces in atlases.'The Greeks, evidently descended from tribes who had come \nwestwards from the early home of Indo-Europeans in South-Central-Asia, first settled in the land which we know \nas Greece about 2000 B.C....' according to The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All Nations, Kaye & Ward \nLtd., London. Their history about Ion, the king of Helice, and his war with Elsenians, the confederacy of Lonia \nin Asia Minor etc., speaks about their origin and shuffling, i.e., from east to west and again from west to east. \nIt is they who have adopted Vedic Rain-godMitraas theirMithrasand many a temple was built all over Europe for Mithras. Even Goddess \nLakshmi has Her counterpart in Greece 'Pallas Athene' known as early as 2 B.C., and the comedies of Strattis, \nlike Fragmenta Comic of Greece has Indian fables as early as 400 B.C. Hence, if these Theories of Borrowing are \nnegated with the Theories of Commonality, it would suffice to say that Ramayana is antecedent to the settlement \nof Greeks in Greece itself.Without lingering on these carbon-testing for the verses \nof Ramayana that contain Yavana and Shaka named provinces, if the astronomical data available in Ramayana itself \nis believed, it throws some light on dating. If anybody would care to see the bookVastav \nRamayan, by Dr.P.V.Vartak, in Marathi, Vedvidnyana Mandal, Pune,and a web site is available about this,Astronomical Dating of the Ramayanawhere another approach \ncan be seen, which just does not revolve around one or two names of places. It is said there; 'Therefore, Ramayana \n'must have' occurred 9600 years ago, which is 7600 B.C. approximately...' which again is disputable because this \nis going against theYuga and KalpaTheory of Puraana-s, as Ramayana is said to be \nthe legend ofTreta Yuga.The provinces Shuurasena, Bharata, Kuru are the downlands \nof Himalayas. The Kaambhoja is the province northwest to India, where the Russia touches India, as mapped by 'An \nHistorical Atlas of the Indian Peninsula' of Oxford University. Then the Yavana and Shaka should be around there, \nprior to their migration to the presently known Greece, because Greeks originated from so called 'South-Central-Asia' \nas called by the historians, and perhaps the historians might be hesitating to call it as 'Himalayan region of \nIndia'. They were originally called Ionians, a corrupt or generic name from Indian naming of Yavana or Javana. \nThe word Ãoni can be cleaved asa + yoni; [ayogya ] yonim gata'unbefitting, uterus, obtained \nbirth...' 'one who is born to an unbefitting mother... say, a bastard...' That is what Ådepus Rex proved later. \nThe ethics of these Yavana and Shaka cultures are clearly explained inKarna-Shalya samvaada'the debate of Karna and Shalya...' \ninKarna parva, Maha Bharata.The Shakas are again the nomadic tribes inhibiting Central \nAsia, and they are the Scythes of Greeks and the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, inhibited in the Hindu Kush Range \nof Himalayas. Both of these are categorised under Mleccha people by Ramayana because their ethics do not conform \nto the Vedic stipulations of living, even though they lived together.'The Varadas - The Bengali recension has Daradas instead. \nThey are said to be Dards whose name is still retained in modern Durdstan along the course of the Indus, above \nthe Himalayas, just before it descends to India...' Griffith, Ancient Geography.It may be noticed that Ramayana did not refute any other \nreligion, or sects, or the divergent philosophies of Hinduism itself, but it has agreed that Mleccha-s are there \nand there is no bother from them. Gods of Ramayana are purely Vedic, unlike the later time, rather modern or artificial \nliterary period's poetry of Kalidasa et al, and their puranic deities like Kali, Uma, and Kumara etc. The literary \nstyle of Ramayana is mostly un-Paninian. It has the episodes likeRama-Jaabaali samvaada, where Sage Jaabaali being a nihilist starts preaching nihilism to Rama. When this \nepic could accommodate information about nihilists' preaching nihilism to Rama, it can as well afford a few lines \nof information about other philosophies, religions, if they were to be there. Then the present day's Unity in \nDiversity is not apparent and thus it is being assigned to a post-Vedic period, where Veda-s themselves are not \nwritten by some good old sages with white beards, sitting under banyan trees, at any one particular time.Because the ancient history of Greeks came to light firstly, \nthereby India history is chronicled, and the epic Ramayana is known subsequently, relegating the history of Ramayana \nlater to the Greek's invasion on India, may not be appropriate. History has its own black-ages.- - -à¤à¤¤à¤¿ à¤µà¤¾à¤²à¥à¤®à¥à¤à¤¿ à¤°à¤¾à¤®à¤¾à¤¯à¤£à¥ à¤à¤¦à¤¿ à¤à¤¾à¤µà¥à¤¯à¥ à¤à¤¿à¤·à¥à¤à¤¿à¤¨à¥à¤§ à¤à¤¾à¤£à¥à¤¡à¥ à¤¤à¥à¤°à¤¿ à¤à¤¤à¥à¤µà¤¾à¤°à¤¿à¤¨à¥à¤¶à¤ à¤¸à¤°à¥à¤à¤Thus, this is the 43rd chapter in Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First\nEpic poem of India.Verse Locator for Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The\nEmpire of Holy Monkeys : Chapter 43Top of Page1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162Â© Sept, 2002, Desiraju Hanumanta Rao [Revised :\nNovember 04]More on \n    verse and\n    \n      and also \n    locatorSecure SFTP and FTPS provided by \n  \n    FREE GoFTP Client"
