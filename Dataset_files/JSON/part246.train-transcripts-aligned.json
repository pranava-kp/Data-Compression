And he says that drivers who have done nothing wrong in an accident are actually at greater risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder about the accident than people who were really at fault for an accident. Quote, \"someone who falls asleep at the wheel knows what they can do to prevent future accidents. Innocent drivers,\" Hickling says, \"realize they're at the mercy of the universe.\"",
