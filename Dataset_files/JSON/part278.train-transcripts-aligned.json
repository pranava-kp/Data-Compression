They call and make sure that you work where you say you work, and then an accountant has to say that, for your field, it is possible to make what you say you make. But they don't say what you make. They just say, it's possible that he could make that. And loan officers would have an accountant that they could call up and say, oh, can you write a statement saying that a truck driver can make this much money? Or whatever.",

These are all put together and divided into different slices. Jimmy used the word \"tranche.\" \"Tranche\" is just French for \"slice.\" Some of these slices are risky, and some are not. A CDO is a pool of these tranches, a pool of pools. And Jim and most companies like his weren't buying the top-rated tranches, the safest ones, the triple-As. They were buying the lower-rated stuff, the high-risk stuff.",

Looked at one way, this hasn't gone so badly for Clarence. He's lived in a house for free for nearly three years.",
